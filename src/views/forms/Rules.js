                <p>We are an English speaking server, all communication must be primarily conducted via English. 
				Fluency in English is required to join the community.</p>
                
                <p>You must be 18 years or older to apply for white-listing to the community. 
				This is non-negotiable to ensure we are within ToS for all 3rd party applications we utilize. 
				All characters on the server must be portrayed with a minimum age of 18.</p>
                
                <p>You must have a working microphone with no background noise and decent quality overall sound. 
				Failure to maintain good quality audio will result in application denial or temporary ban until the audio is fixed.</p>
                
                <p>We require all community members to utilize the WildRP Discord for communication and permissions management. 
				Failure to maintain membership in the Discord server will result in community removal.</p>
                
                <p>Should disagreements or instances of rule-breaking arise in game all members should attempt to roleplay through them
				without breaking character. Once the scenario is completed, members may then send in reports to staff. If the previous 
				is impossible, a WildRP staff member may contacted immediately. Out of character (OOC) arguments will not be tolerated. 
				If you believe a player has broken a rule submit a report via the Website Report feature rather then 
				starting an argument.</p>

                <p>If a person's overall quality of roleplay ability is deemed too low/inconsistent for the server, that person may be placed under staff 
				review. Subject to staff review any person on the server may receive disciplinary actions up to and including permanent bans for 
				character conduct which is deemed detrimental to the server.</p>

                <p>All weapons are fully dangerous/lethal at all times unless a server announcement from staff is made for a specific event. This means 
				all shootings and stabbings are real and must be dealt with through roleplay as if they are real. Practice fighting with weapons is not 
				allowed. Theatrical fighting should be restricted to stage areas and conducted in pre-announced events.
				All set duels with other characters will result in permanent character death/injury for the losing side.</p>

                <p>The utilization of glitches, exploits, hacks, third party crosshairs/aim pips, or bugs for personal gain will result in a ban from the server. 
				Hacking in particular is zero tolerance and will result in a permanent ban. If you find a glitch or in-game exploit 
				please notify the staff via the website forms.</p>

                <p>Erotic Roleplay of any kind is not tolerated and will result in a permanent ban. Forced relationship roleplay/potential rape and anything 
				remotely close to it will also result in a permanent ban.</p>

                <p>Suicide Roleplay of any kind is not tolerated and will result in a permanent ban.</p>

				conciousness, or dying.</p>
                
                <p>Players should not purposefully utilize information gained during an incapacitated, unconscious, or dead 
				state to directly self benefit, get revenge, report on criminals, or otherwise negatively impact other's roleplay.</p> 
                
                <p>If a player is gravely injured (multiple gunshot wounds, bear/wolf attack, multiple knife wounds, poison, being thrown off a cliff, etc) 
				the injured player should not be communicating well until healed and should limit communication and memory of the incident and the 
				period of time leading up to treatment.</p>
                
                <p>Should a player revive via pressing F to revive at the nearest doctor, that player must avoid returning to the area of "incapacitation" 
				for a significant amount of time on any character.</p> 
				
                <p>Should a character die, that player must avoid bringing another character to the same area for a significant amount of time, and 
				must forgot all information the dead character knew.</p>

				other's lives.</p>
                <p>Frequent participation in vigilantism, quick drawing/rapidly pulling weapons, or other violent/dangerous behavior likely to lead to 
				severe injury or death can possibly be considered failure to value life. Community members may ask the staff team for a definitive answer 
				as to whether specific behaviours would be considered failure to value life.</p>

				<p>1. Permanent character death with OOC consent from all parties involved. </p>
				<p>2. Temporary shelving of character (not playing this character for a specific amount of time) with OOC consent from all parties involved. </p>
				<p>3. Roleplay/Gameplay effect. This typically involves temporary consequences such injury, captivity, robbery, or another solution which

                <h3 className="">BANK ROBBERY RULES</h3>
                
                <p>The following rules are designed to ensure bank robberies are a mechanic which encourages good roleplay 
		while providing an intense, yet mutually enjoyable event for all parties involved.</p>

		<p>1. In order to rob a bank there must be at least 4 Law on duty. Following our group size rule, the maximum 
		number of criminal players that may participate in a bank robbery is 6, all criminals not directly involved 
		in the bank robbery are expected to leave town due to the increased danger. This number will be adjusted as 
		per server needs. Part of planning for a bank robbery is ensuring there are no more than 6 criminals fighting 
		the Law at one time, even if the criminals retreat to a hideout or something similar.</p>

		<p>2. For the time being, only 2 members of the robbery party may be outside of the bank (on a roof, waiting with 
		horses, down the street, etc.) during a robbery. All 6 outlaws/robbers involved in a Bank Robbery must be 
		waiting within town limits. Lawmen will have the option to ask how many outlaws are involved in the robbery, 
		and if there are any on the outside. The outlaws must answer truthfully so Law can ensure those not involved 
		are clearing the area.</p>

		<p>3. Players should plan to be identified after a robbery, significant federal effort will be spent identifying 
		bank robbers, and NPCs will be rewarded for sharing information. Robbers may wear masks or disguises, but 
		will likely be identified due to the length and amount of people involved in a robbery.</p> 

		<p>4. Each Player may only rob a bank once every 4 days, this includes the person initiating the robbery and 
		the people involved within the active robbery. This is a simple measure to prevent the mechanic from 
		being overused. This number will be adjusted as per server needs.</p>

		<p>5. If you are in town when a bank robbery begins, please RP as such. A bank robbery is a very dangerous 
		situation and it will be expected all uninvolved players act accordingly and follow the directives of 
		those involved in the scenario.The only players that should provide medical assistance at any point during 
		a bank robbery are those involved from either the criminal or Law side at the incident, all uninvolved 
		medics are expected to leave the area as well. Any character that is hanging around near a bank robbery may 
		be potentially be charged with a crime due to Peace Officers declaring Martial Law.</p>

		<p>6. If Bank Robbers choose to take player hostages, it must be via an organic interaction. Arranging hostages 
		via OOC pre-planning is not allowed. Bank NPCs are spawned in to be utilized as hostages, and are expected 
		to be treated as players during Robbery scenarios. All hostage taking is requested to be conducted with good 
		etiquette, and any form of excessive violence or torture involving hostages which detracts from the 
		Robbery scenario is discouraged.</p> 

		<p>7. Law will treat all hostages and the safety of the citizenry as their priority during Bank Robberies. 
		They will most likely declare Martial Law and clear the street the Bank is located on. Law will not attempt 
		to breach, engage, or generally conduct offensive movement until they verify hostage safety/death via hostage 
		transfers. Law will ask how many robbers are involved in the situation, and how many hostages the robbers have, 
		and expect a truthful response. Law will be set up to engage, but will not engage until the criminals initiate combat.</p>

		<p>8. If the Outlaw/Robber group decides during a Robbery to engage in a shootout, they are required to fire a warning 
		shot. The reasoning behind this is so no player is immediately killed without a chance to engage in the roleplay 
		scenario. When/if outlaws have decided they would like to escalate a robbery into violence, they must fire off a 
		shot and wait 10 seconds before engaging in combat. Once the robbers have fired off their initial shot and waited 
		the 10 seconds, the situation is considered to have moved into combat and all parties are free to engage at will.</p>

                <p>Impersonation of government officials and Law Enforcement Officers is allowed. Falsification of 
		ID documents or Law Enforcement badges is not. If a player asks for an impersonator for "official 
		identification", then impersonation should not occur or cease happening. Failure to adhere to this rule will

		department, a civilian business) will have higher expectations in communication, gameplay, and rules adherence 
		placed upon them. Staff reserves the right to impose these expectations and issue OOC guidance to 
		in-game leaders due to the nature of server impact in game leaders have.</p>
